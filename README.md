# Bank-Loan-Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **data analytics workflow** in the **Banking & Financial Services** domain.  
Using **38,000+ loan records across 24 attributes**, the analysis uncovers key insights into loan applications, repayments, credit risk, and customer segments.  

The project leverages **Power BI, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel** to build interactive dashboards, perform data cleaning & modeling, and generate actionable business intelligence.
